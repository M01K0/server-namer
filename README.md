# server-namer

A simple in memory rest endpoint store and skeleton for a webapp

## Purpose

We'd like to use this base to build an interesting interface that showcases servers whose
names are auto-generated by our backend.

## API

### Server Name `/server-name/`

This endpoint returns a random generated name

```GET /server-name/
{"name": "random-server-name"}
```

### Store `/store/`

A REST endpoint that saves arbitrary JSON data to an in-memory store on the backend.

- `GET /store/`
  - gets all objects
- `GET /store/1`
  - gets object with id 1
- `POST /store/ {"key": "value"}`
  - stores a new object
- `POST /store/1`
  - alias for PUT
- `PUT /store/1 {"key": "value"}`
  - replaces object with id 1
- `DELETE /store/1`
  - deletes object with id 1
